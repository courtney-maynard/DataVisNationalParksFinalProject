      <h2 id='inspTitle'>Project Inspiration</h2>
      <p id='inspDescription'> This project was inspired by the conversations my family and I have every time we go
        hiking:
        which trail should we hike? Everyone in my family has a different idea about what makes a trail a good hike.
        Thinking about what makes all of us most eager to hike a trail made me question what characteristics of a trail,
        universally, make a trail popular. With this project, I aim to provide a useful tool for helping others to
        determine
        which national park they want to visit and which trails they could hike based on their preferences.
        Additionally, this project will
        explore
        different trail aspects to determine what makes a trail most popular. This project is my
        Final Project for the <b>College of William and Mary's Data Visualization (DATA 303)</b>, course.

      <h2 id='developTitle'>Project Development</h2>
      <p id='developDescription'> The data was downloaded from a Kaggle dataset that was scraped from All Trails three
        years
        ago.
        All Trails is a hiking website/app that contains information regarding all known trails across the United
        States.
        This dataset contained 60 of the 63 National Parks and was the most comprehensive available at the
        time of
        the project. The data was cleansed using Python, and the visualizations were produced with Python and
        Tableau.
        All visualizations aim to help users discover the relationship(s) between trail features and trail
        popularity.
        Lastly, the website was coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
